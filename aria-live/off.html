    <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age
    of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief,
    it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was
    the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter
    of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
    we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the
    other way.</p>

    <p>In short, the period was so far like the present
    period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being
    received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
    comparison only.</p>
