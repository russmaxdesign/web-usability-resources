The most characteristic feature of        pelicans is the elongated bill with its massive throat pouch. The        Australian Pelican's bill is 40 cm - 50 cm long and is larger in males        than females. Pelicans have large wings and a wingspan of 2.3 m -        2.5 m.</p>        <h4>Where does it live?</h4>        <h5>Distribution</h5>        <p>The Australian Pelican is found throughout Australia, Papua New        Guinea and western Indonesia, with occasional reports in New Zealand        and various western Pacific islands. <a href="table.htm">See the        distribution chart for more detailed information.</a></p>        <h5>Habitat</h5>        <p>Pelicans are widespread on freshwater, estuarine and marine wetlands        and waterways including lakes, swamps, rivers, coastal islands and        shores.</p>        <h5>Seasonal movements</h5>        <p>Pelicans are highly mobile, searching out suitable areas of water        and an adequate supply of food. Pelicans are not capable of sustained        flapping flight, but can remain in the air for 24 hours, covering        hundreds of kilometres. They are excellent soarers and can use thermals        to rise to considerable altitudes. Flight at 1,000m is common, and        heights of 3 000 m have been recorded. By moving from one thermal to        the next, pelicans can travel long distances with a minimum of effort,        reaching air speeds of up to 56 km/hour.</p>        <h4>What do pelicans do?</h4>        <div class="toggle">          <h5> Feeding</h5>          <p>The bill and pouch of pelicans play an important role in feeding.          The bill is sensitive and this helps locate fish in murky water. It          also has a hook at the end of the upper mandible, probably for          gripping slippery food items. When food is caught, the pelican          manipulates it in its bill until the prey typically has its head          pointing down the pelican's throat. Then with a jerk of the head the          pelican swallows the prey. The bill is delicately built. The lower          jaw consists of two thin and weakly articulated bones from which the          pouch hangs. When fully extended, the bill can hold up to 13 litres.          The pouch does not function as a place to hold food for any length          of time. Instead it serves as a short-term collecting organ. Pelicans          plunge their bills into the water, using their pouches as nets. Once          something is caught, a pelican draws its pouch to its breast. This          empties the water and allows the bird to manoeuvre the prey into a          swallowing position. The pouch can also serve as a net to catch food          thrown by humans, and there are sightings of pelicans drinking by          opening their bill to collect rainwater.</p>          <p>  The Australian Pelican may feed alone, but more often feeds as a          cooperative group. Sometimes these groups are quite large. One group          numbered over 1,900 birds. A flock of pelicans works together,          driving fish into a concentrated mass using their bills and sometimes          by beating their wings. The fish are herded into shallow water or          surrounded in ever decreasing circles.          </p>          <h5>Breeding</h5>          <p>Breeding depends on environmental conditions, particularly          rainfall. Pelicans are colonial breeders with up to 40 000 individuals          grouping on islands or secluded shores. Breeding begins with          courtship. The female leads potential mates (two to eight or more)          around the colony. As the males follow her in these walks, they          threaten each other while swinging their open bills from side to side          trying to attract the female's attention. The males may also pick up          small objects, like sticks or dry fish, which they toss in the air          and catch again, repeating the sequence several times.</p>          <p>Both sexes perform &quot;pouch-rippling&quot; in which they clap          their bills shut several times a second and the pouch ripples like a          flag in a strong breeze. As the courtship parade progresses, the males          drop out one by one. Finally, after pursuits on land, water or in the          air, only a single male is left. The female leads him to a potential          nest site.</p>          <p>During the courtship period, the bill and pouch of the birds          change colour dramatically. The forward half of the pouch becomes          bright salmon pink, while the skin of the pouch in the throat region          turns chrome yellow. Parts of the top and base of the bill change to          cobalt blue, and a black diagonal strip appears from the base to the          tip. This colour change is of short duration, the intensity usually          subsiding by the time incubation starts.</p>          <p>The nest consists of a scrape in the ground prepared by the female.          She digs the scrape with her bill and feet, and lines it with any          scraps of vegetation or feathers within reach of the nest. Within          three days egg-laying begins and eggs are laid two to three days          apart. Both parents share incubation and the eggs are incubated on          their feet.</p>          <p>The first-hatched chick is substantially larger than its siblings.          It receives most of the food and may even attack and kill its nest          mates. A newly hatched pelican has a large bill, bulging eyes, and          skin that looks like small-grained bubble plastic. The skin around          the face is mottled with varying degrees of black and the colour of          the eyes varies from white to dark brown. This individual variation          helps the parents to recognise their chick from hundreds of          others.</p>          <p>The chicks leave their nests to form creches of up to 100 birds.          They remain in creches for about two months, by the end of which          they have learnt to fly and are fairly independent. Wild birds may          live between ten and possibly 25 years or more.</p>        </div>        <div>          <h3><a href="pelicantable.html#observations" class="observe">Latest observation results</a></h3>        </div>        <div id="result">          <div id="reference" role="complementary">            <h3>References</h3>            <ul>              <li>Battam, H., Leishman, A.J. and Smith, L.E. 1986.
